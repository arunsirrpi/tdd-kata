# TDD Kata

TDD Kata is an exercise in coding, refactoring and test-first, that you should apply daily for at least 15 minutes.

## Setup

Clone the repository and create a unique branch in the developers folder such as `developers/brandtdaniels`. Please do not merge your branch into master.

See specific language based setup instructions for more details. Create the proper `.gitignore` files as necessary. Please do not commit any project files, only tests and implementation source with the exception of any necessary package structure.

## Before you start

- Try not to read ahead.
- Do one task at a time. The trick is to learn to work incrementally.
- Make sure you only test for correct inputs. There is no need to test for invalid inputs for this kata.
